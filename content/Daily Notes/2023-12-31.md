One year on! Not writing this note from Waterstones, instead from my (rented) flat in Battlefield. Wow! I'm watching the HIMYM episode, and I feel cosy. I'm celebrating the bells with Andrew and Jack, and it's going to be quite nice. Adam's out at a rave, something I had no ambition to do whatsoever. I'm really sad we can't spend NYE together, but I don't want him to miss out on that experience, and I simply don't want to partake. There's nothing wrong with that! They've just seen Moby, btw.

I'm in a much much much better place than I was when I wrote this note last year. I think that trend will continue!
