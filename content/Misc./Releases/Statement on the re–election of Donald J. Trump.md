**This morning, I was still blurry-eye when I saw that America had elected Donald Trump as their 47th president.** I put my phone down, choosing not to engage with the news. I remember the last Trump presidency—how all-consuming, dangerous, and devastating it felt. 

I want to be clear about how I feel regarding this election. I'm deeply disheartened by the outcome and troubled by what it represents. The fact that so many Americans have chosen to reelect a fascist, rapist, insurrectionist with a history of corruption and divisiveness is incredibly difficult to accept. I strongly reject his brand of populism, his authoritarian tendencies, and the influence that far-right weirdos will now have on U.S. policy.

I am deeply concerned about the impact this will have on the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans, women, and BIPOC communities. Trump, surrounded by his dangerous weirdo-gang, are a real threat to these groups.

In all honesty, I'm still processing the news. I've spent the day sofa–rotting, considering if I even have the fight in me. Trump's first term was exhausting, can anyone even be arsed with this? But sofa–rotting is not a productive use of time. Sofa–rotting leads to depression. We've been doing well integrating running into our life, and while we're currently resting our ankles, we can't go back to the old way full time. Today, we saw the worst of America, and its tempting to respond with the worst of ourselves. Out of respect for ourselves, **I will not allow this.** We'll be back to work, as normal, tomorrow, as the journey on building a better, more active person continues.

As we enter what will undoubtably be a repugnant age of dreadful online discourse, and reflecting on a fantastic talk by Maggie Appleton at UX Brighton, I think it's time to shift our presence on the web away from platforms run by people like Elon Musk, and towards cosier, more intentional public spaces. I'm already exploring these avenues and will be talking more about it soon. 

I am not a politician, nor am I a public figure. For that reason, I'm not bound by any requirement to be diplomatic or even pretend that any of this is normal. With that in mind, I'd like to finish by formally condemning the hundreds of millions of fucking retards across all 50 of the so-called "United" States, who were either dumb enough to be tricked by this man, or sick enough to vote for him anyway. Go fuck yourselves, I hope you rot in hell forever.  
  
With peace and love, and with my friends in the US in my thoughts,  
Sam
