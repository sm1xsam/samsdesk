This note serves as an introduction to the atomic note-taking mindset, designed to break down larger topics into small, self-contained, and interlinked notes. This approach allows for a well-organised digital garden where each idea or piece of information stands alone yet is connected, making it easier to expand on or revisit later.

## Atomic Note Principles

1. **Single Thought, Single Note**
   - Each note should capture one idea or concept. This makes it easier to understand at a glance and prevents it from becoming too cluttered or hard to use.
   - **Example**: Instead of writing a large “Glasgow Subway System” note, break it down:
     - **Note 1**: "Glasgow Subway Overview" – Covers general facts about the subway system.
     - **Note 2**: "Subway Stations" – Lists and describes key stations.
     - **Note 3**: "Hillhead Station" – A detailed focus on a specific station.
     - **Linking**: Each of these notes can link back to each other, creating a web of information.

2. **Interlinking Related Notes**
   - When one thought branches into another, create a separate note and link them together. This prevents information overload in a single note and builds connections across different topics.
   - **Example**: While writing about Class 385 Trains, you might think of “Railway Electrification in Scotland.”
     - Create a separate “Railway Electrification in Scotland” note.
     - In the “Class 385 Trains” note, add a link to `[[Railway Electrification in Scotland]]` and vice versa, fostering a network of ideas.

3. **Specificity for Clarity and Reusability**
   - Keep notes specific so that they’re immediately understandable and useful on their own.
   - **Example**: Instead of a vague “Design Ideas” note, create something like “Gradient Indicators for Login Screens”:
     - **Content**: Discuss how gradients can show progress in meeting password strength criteria.
     - Link to a more general `[[Colour Usage in UX Design]]` or `[[User Feedback Visual Cues]]` note.

4. **Stubs for Random Thoughts**
   - Use stub notes for random or fleeting ideas, which you can expand on later.
   - **Example**: “Why don’t more people cycle in Glasgow?”  
     - This can start as a question and grow over time, perhaps linking to notes on urbanism, public transport, or Glasgow’s geography.

5. **Thematic Tags for Organisation**
   - Use broad tags to keep your notes easy to search. Themes like `#trains`, `#design`, or `#urbanism` make it simple to pull up related notes quickly.

6. **Periodic Review and Refinement**
   - Regularly revisit and add details or new links to older notes. This process will reveal unexpected connections and solidify knowledge across different topics.

## Step-by-Step Example for Building Your Notes

### Step 1: Capture the Initial Thought
   - Let’s say you’re thinking about the Glasgow Subway. Start with a single, atomic note:
     - **Title**: “Glasgow Subway Overview”
     - **Content**: Write a brief summary about the Glasgow Subway’s history, structure, and notable features.

### Step 2: Branch Out with Linked Notes
   - Now, think of any sub-topics or questions that arise, like individual stations or the map.
   - Create separate notes for each (e.g., “Subway Stations,” “Hillhead Station”) and link them.

### Step 3: Use Specific Examples
   - For design concepts, start specific (e.g., “Gradient Indicators for Login Screens”) and link to other concepts like “Colour Usage in UX Design.”

### Step 4: Add Tags
   - Apply a general tag, like `#GlasgowSubway` or `#Design`, to each note for easy retrieval later.

### Step 5: Regularly Review and Refine
   - Periodically revisit these notes to add new insights or connections that emerge over time.

This approach keeps ideas well-organised, easy to reference, and always evolving as you explore new connections. Over time, your digital garden will grow, with each note connecting in meaningful ways, creating a unique knowledge network.
