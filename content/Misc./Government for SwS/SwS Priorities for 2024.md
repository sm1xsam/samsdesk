> Priorities are set by the Government for SwS, and will be delivered throughout 2024. There is room for adjustments to priorities as the year develops and natural changes in circumstances occur.


Each December, we set various new years resolutions for the year ahead. For 2024, these are as follows:

## A revitalised relationship with work
1. When working from home, we'll work primarily in our home office
2. We'll be more focused during the 9-5 hours. Get out of bed in the morning, and start work early. Less emphasis on after-work working
3. We'll make use of AI tools such as our own workGPT to enhance our productivity
4. We'll commit to attending the BBC office in Pacific Quay in person, at least once a week
5. We'll run personal weekly planning sessions on a Monday morning
6. We'll run personal weekly reflection sessions on a Friday morning

## A healthier life
1. Our phone will charge overnight in the living room, away from the bedroom
2. We'll wake up at a reasonable and consistent time using a combination of a soothing HomePod-powered alarm, and smart lighting
3. We'll have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks at a reasonable and consistent time, setting us up for further progress with ARFID treatment as the year progresses
4. We'll phase in running in Queen's Park following a successful trial in late 2023
5. We'll phase in regular yoga sessions to increase flexibility
6. We'll commit to taking one multivitamin and one vitamin D tablet per day
7. We'll commit to 2x 2 minute teeth brushing sessions + flossing per day, using music as a motivator
8. We'll reduce alcohol consumption, switching from an alcohol-primary person to a weed-primary person, enabled by weed independence
9. We'll formally enforce use of social media screen-time limitations for Instagram and Twitter

## A happier life
1. We'll embrace the lifestyle changes we're committing to and reap the many benefits
2. We'll seek to establish Glasgow-first friendships, further separating ourself from our Cumbernauld past
3. We'll work harder on our hobbies, enhancing our coding and digital skills
4. We'll continue to splurge on fashion when we can afford to
5. We'll listen to all of Taylor Swift's albums to ensure we have an even deeper understanding of her entire catalogue
6. We'll also listen to more varieties of music, to further our auditory education
7. We'll be gayer, and return to 2018/19 levels of pride
8. We'll embrace our neurodiversity, and be bound by the following principles:
	- everyone is just a person, no one knows anything
	- embrace the cringe
	- you're funnier when you're yourself
9. We'll vote Scottish Green in elections in 2024 where possible, while leaving open the option of voting for an individual candidate based on merit where Green isn't available
10. We will offer an iron clad, guaranteed commitment that we will never vote Conservative 
11. We'll permanently end the use of unfriendly language of a racial nature
12. We'll learn to play chess
