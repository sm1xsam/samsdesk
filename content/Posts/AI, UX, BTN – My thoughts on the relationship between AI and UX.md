I recently attended UX Brighton 2024, which had the theme of 'UX & AI'. As I continue learning and using AI, my perspective has been evolving, but I still find myself frustrated with the way it's being used in [many](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/meta-is-testing-an-ai-powered-search-bar-in-instagram/) [places](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Hands-on-with-Apples-new-Image-Playground-app_id164512) [across](https://community.etsy.com/t5/Technical-Issues/I-tested-Etsy-s-Search-and-it-was-BAD/td-p/144802879) [the](https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/) [web](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator/text-to-vector-graphic.html). The conference hosted 8 speakers, who each gave their own perspective on the subject. 

After revisiting my notes from Brighton, I started to think more deeply about my view on the relationship between AI and UX. I've summarised my current thoughts in the points below:

### 1. The challenges in human-AI communication

I've had conversations with ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode, and it's the closest I've ever experienced to having a fully natural conversation with a computer. Sometimes, you notice it's limits – like when it interrupts you because it's interpreted your silence as the end of your point, not just a moment of thought.

- **AI isn't human – and it's lacking the ability to communicate with humans holistically**
	- Human speech has evolved over millennia, with natural mechanisms for handling misunderstandings that are missing in AI interactions
	- AI struggles with universal conversational patterns that span cultures, especially non-verbal cues like agreement, tactful disagreement, and ways to repair misunderstandings
- **Humans communicate non-verbally**
	- Effective conversation is often grounded in non-verbal signals – like posture, tone, rhythm, and pauses – things that keep both speakers aligned
	- AI currently lacks the ability to interpret these cues, which hinders its capacity to participate in truly human conversations
- **AI can't interpret silence properly**
	- In human conversation, silence can mean much more than just you coming to the end of your thought
	- AI often interprets silence as a signal to conclude, missing the subtleties that silence can convey

### 2. Interface Design and User Experience

- **The chatbot doesn't need to be the default input method for AI**
	- The chatbot interface has become synonymous with AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) – but it doesn’t align with human-centred design principles
	- Presenting users with a blank input box and expecting them to navigate prompt engineering can be intimidating and unhelpful
	- Generic calls to action like “ask me anything” often add to user anxiety rather than offering guidance
	- We need to stop bolting these "smart" textboxes onto existing interfaces for the sake of adding AI – this does not bring value to the experience, and it devalues AI in general
- **AI can be integrated throughout the experience**
	- Instead of requiring users to craft their own prompts, the design can offer pre-written prompts as buttons or other accessible elements
		- Smart prompt generation that updates as you type
	- Apple has a really nice way of building prompts in its [Image Playground app](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/) (which is the only thing I like about it)
	- Going deeper – strip out the chatbot completely and let all of the AI communication happen behind the scenes, hidden behind common and accepted UX patterns

I'm not fully writing off the chatbot as a method of communication with AI – I think it definitely has its place. But, there are a number of opportunities where AI can add real value to an experience – things like tidying an inbox, grouping notes by common themes, or building a really specific music playlist, where the AI magic can be better presented through more traditional user interface elements, or even completely reimagined ones. 

### 3. Prototyping and User Testing with AI

- **Enhanced User Testing with Real Data**
	- Using real data in user testing results in more realistic feedback
	- Generative AI can facilitate this by helping designers—regardless of coding skills—to create prototypes that simulate live interactions using real data


### 4. AI and the State of the Internet

- **Dark Forest Theory of the Internet**
	- The internet has become a “dark forest” where genuine human content is increasingly drowned out by artificial noise—bots, advertisers, trolls, clickbait, data scrapers, and algorithm-driven content. Post-2016, especially, this oversaturation has led to a craving for authentic spaces. The rise of AI exacerbates this, as AI-generated content blends almost indistinguishably with human-created material, making it harder to find truly human connections online.
