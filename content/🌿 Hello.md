 **Hi, I'm Sam Smith, a designer from Glasgow, Scotland.** This is my desk – an evolving collection of thoughts and notes related to topics like design, urbanism, ai, public transport, and technology. 

I’m building this space as a personal digital garden, a place where I can capture and revisit ideas over time. Some notes are polished, others are just half-formed ideas. 

#### How to navigate
Pages on this site are divided into **posts**, **thoughts**, and **notes**. You can browse by these categories, or use the search bar to look for keywords or tags.

- **Posts** – long-form, thought out blog posts about things that interest me. Usually a bit of effort's gone into them.
- **Thoughts** – less formal, more casual blog posts. Sometimes the cuff observations.
- **Notes** – a curated selection of my notes about various subjects.
