- A deep understanding of people who are impacted by the service, as well as their tasks and environments is crucial
- **Human–centred** design, as opposed to user–centred, as it's taking into account all the people who will be impacted, not just the immediate users
- Users are involved directly with design throughout the process
- The feedback of users has a direct impact on your direction of travel
- We can quickly respond to research findings and make decisions based on data rather than assumptions
- The design is built to consider all [[My Interpretation of Peter Morville's UX Honeycomb |facets of the user experience]]

How important is user research? At what point is user research important?
How can we balance **users being directly involved** with an acceptance that taste is not a given, and some people don't know what they want until they see it.
