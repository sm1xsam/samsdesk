As a huge fan of both Paul and Taylor, it was heartwarming to see. It must have been interesting for Paul, amidst a crowd of Swifties, to experience a Beatlemania-like atmosphere from the audience’s perspective. Both he and Taylor belong to a rare group of legendary performers who captivate audiences in such a powerful way. **It also made me wonder what a ‘Paul McCartney Eras Tour’ setlist would look like.**

Paul McCartney has been touring for over 50 years, and his setlists over the last two decades have touched on both the [extremes of his early days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s80WkUa2kps) and his [very latest work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hshwhaEqm5Q). However, he always neglects the middle period of his career – post-Wings but before his recent albums. The only song from the post-80s and pre-2010s he regularly performs is his tribute to John Lennon, “Here Today.”, from 1982’s “Tug of War” album. While I understand that most people attending a McCartney show in 2024 want to hear Beatles classics, as a Macca superfan, I dream of an all-encompassing Eras Tour that isn’t afraid to dive into the deep cuts.

Fresh from both seeing the Eras tour myself, **and** securing tickets to see Paul (for the second time) later this year, I set myself a poster design challenge to recreate Taylor Swift’s iconic poster - swapping her career-spanning eras for ten key periods from Sir Paul’s career. This project involved the creation of the poster, as well as the hard work of figuring out what ten eras make up the life of the world’s greatest musician, and what songs from each one I’d like him to sing. Obviously, Sir Paul already does a three hour set (!!) – so the below setlist is both entirely unrealistic and a complete work of fantasy.
