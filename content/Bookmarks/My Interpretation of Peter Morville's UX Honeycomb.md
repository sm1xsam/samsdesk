### Useful
- Are our products and systems useful?
- Morville argues *"We can’t be content to paint within the lines drawn by managers. We must have the courage and creativity to ask whether our products and systems are useful, and to apply our knowledge of craft + medium to define innovative solutions that are more useful"*

### Useable
- Of course it has to be useable, but that's not enough on its own
- Consider all input and output methods

### Desirable
- The value of taste

### Findable
- Understanding navigation patterns, storytelling, and composition to make our experiences navigable and intuitive 

### Accessible
- Accessible design benefits all users, not just those with disabilities. For example, subtitles serve both users with hearing impairments and those in noisy environments
- Accessibility is a driver of innovation

### Credible 
- Design has to support in building trust with the audience

### Valuable
- Design should be bringing value to all stakeholders – including the audience
