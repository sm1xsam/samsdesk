Ferreira outlined several issues with traditional and synthetic research approaches, particularly highlighting the following:

1. **Limitations of Traditional User Research**:
   - **Time-Intensive**: Conducting thorough user research takes a considerable amount of time.
   - **Costly**: Recruiting and maintaining research participants can be prohibitively expensive.
   - **Recruitment Challenges**: Certain audiences are hard to recruit, and participant attrition is high.
   - **Competitive Secrecy**: Protecting insights can be challenging, as organic research can lead to leaks.
   - **Data Interpretation**: It can be difficult to surface and interpret valuable insights amidst large data sets.

  

2. **Drawbacks of Synthetic User Research**:
   - **GPTs and Behaviour Simulation**: Current generative AI models are often too generic when simulating human behaviour, lacking the authenticity of real user interactions.
   - **Cross-Cultural Complexity**: Simulating diverse audiences presents a challenge, as AI struggles to authentically represent cross-cultural nuances.
   - **High Variant Output**: Generative AI can create a vast number of variants, but selecting the "right" solution among these can be overwhelming.


Ferreira argued that despite these drawbacks, synthetic research can offer unique benefits because it reflects the mixed organic and synthetic reality of the modern world. He downplayed the drive toward superintelligence in AI, noting that humans themselves are far from superintelligent, positioning synthetic users as a complement to organic ones.

## Reflections on the Talk

While Ferreira’s talk highlighted genuine pain points in traditional user research, I’m sceptical about the idea of using AI to simulate users. There are undoubtedly useful applications for AI in user research, but simulating user behaviour isn’t at the top of the list.

Here’s where I see the value of AI in this space:

- **Automating Tedious Tasks**: AI can streamline the mundane aspects of user research, like capturing insights from post-it notes or clustering similar themes. This would free up researchers to focus on synthesising insights rather than manual data organisation.
- **Assisting in Thematic Analysis**: Instead of generating synthetic users, AI could support researchers by automating the legwork of grouping themes and patterns, making it faster and easier to interpret results.

In short, real users provide invaluable insights that synthetic users can’t replace. The focus should be on using AI to support researchers by speeding up workflows and automating repetitive tasks, not on replacing genuine user interactions with simulated ones.
