Proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative AI content

## Key Concepts

- **Dark Forest Theory of the Web**:
	- Public online spaces are increasingly overrun by bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, and algorithmically manipulated content.
	- Genuine human interactions are retreating to private, closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and digital gardens.

- **Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
	- There has been a recent surge in LLM-powered tools (e.g., Jasper, Moonbeam, [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai),Anyword) designed to generate advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages.
	- These models, trained on vast amounts of web text, produce human-like content, leading to a flood of generic, generated material online.



## Challenges Ahead

- **Content Saturation**:
	- Anticipated increase in low-quality, AI-generated content across various platforms, making it harder to find original human insights and authentic connections.

- **Authenticity Verification**:
	- Growing difficulty in distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated content.
	- Emergence of the "reverse Turing test," where humans must prove their authenticity online.



## Strategies to Signal Humanity

1. **Triangulate Objective Reality**:
	- Share detailed, context-rich stories grounded in personal experiences and local knowledge.
	- Reference recent events and niche interests to demonstrate awareness beyond AI capabilities.

2. **Demonstrate Original, Critical Thinking**:
	- Offer unique insights and analyses that go beyond generic summaries.
	- Engage in sophisticated discussions, showcasing depth of thought.

3. **Utilise Creative Language and Cultural References**:
	- Incorporate neologisms, jargon, memes, and evolving internet lingo that AI may struggle to replicate.
	- Develop a distinctive voice and style that reflects individual personality.

4. **Consider Institutional Verification**:
	- Explore methods of verification by trusted institutions to establish online authenticity.
	- Be cautious of potential privacy concerns and the practicality of such measures.

5. **Engage in In-Person Interactions**:
	- Strengthen relationships through offline meetings, events, and community involvement.
	- Leverage physical presence as undeniable proof of humanity.



## Conclusion

As generative AI continues to evolve, the online landscape faces challenges in maintaining authentic human connections. By adopting strategies to signal our humanity, we can navigate the expanding "dark forest" and foster genuine interactions in the digital realm.
