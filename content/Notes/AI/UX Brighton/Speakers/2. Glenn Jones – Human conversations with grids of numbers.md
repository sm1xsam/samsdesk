**The way humans talk has been developed over thousands of generations** to become a refined, collaborative process. Jones references _How We Talk: The Inner Workings of Conversation_ by N.J. Enfield in this talk.

# Key Points
### Conversation as Evolutionary Skill  

- Humans have spent thousands of years refining [[3. Hannah Beresford – People won’t use your shiny new AI product||the way we communicate]], and it’s reflected in the small, instinctive behaviours that keep conversations flowing. Misunderstandings are common, but Enfield describes how we’ve developed rapid “repair mechanisms” to deal with them, like repeating what we didn’t catch or clarifying ambiguous statements.

  

### The Role of Non-Verbal Cues  
- Body language is crucial. Nods, eye contact, and gestures aren’t just fillers—they’re essential for signalling engagement, ending a turn, or even softening statements. In some cultures, non-verbal cues replace direct words to avoid seeming blunt, relying on expressions and gestures to make the point.

  

### Universal Patterns in Conversation  
- Enfield argues that certain conversational structures are shared across cultures. All over the world, people instinctively understand how to show agreement, disagree tactfully, and repair misunderstandings. This might mean that conversation’s underlying framework is more biological than cultural—a way of binding people together through shared understanding.

  

### Conversation as a Collaborative Effort  
- Effective conversation requires both parties to stay tuned in, adjusting their responses based on cues from the other person. This is especially clear in engaging conversations where people unconsciously mirror each other’s posture, tone, and rhythm, creating a sense of sync and shared focus.

  

### Silence as a Tool  
- Silence in conversation isn’t just an absence of words—it’s a tool. It can mean “I’m thinking,” invite the other person to fill the gap, or even indicate disapproval. AI, though, struggles with this nuance, often interpreting silence as an opportunity to jump in, missing the layered meanings humans attach to pauses.

  

### Prototyping and Realistic Data  
- When it comes to UX and user testing, prototyping with real data matters. Glenn noted that prototypes with realistic data produce far better results in testing than those with placeholder content. This is where Generative AI is coming in handy: it lets designers, even those with minimal coding knowledge, create prototypes that mimic real interactions, enhancing user testing accuracy.
