### Step-by-Step Prompt Structure


1. **Define a Persona**: Start by assigning a role or persona to the AI. This step shapes the AI’s “perspective” and can influence its responses. Defining a persona can also add specificity and relevance to the output.

   - Example: "You are a financial advisor specialising in investments for young professionals."

  

2. **Provide Core Context**: Offer detailed context that grounds the AI in the scenario. Including relevant background information helps the AI generate a response that aligns more closely with the intended purpose.

   - Example: "I am a 25-year-old new to investing and looking to build a diversified portfolio on a limited budget."

  

3. **Specify the Task**: Clearly outline the specific task you want the AI to perform. This is the core request or objective and should be as direct as possible.

   - Example: "Recommend an investment strategy tailored to my financial situation, with considerations for low-risk options."

  

4. **Add Additional Context**: If there are any extra details that might influence the AI's response, include them here. These can be nuanced elements or specific preferences.

   - Example: "I would prefer ethical and environmentally responsible investment options."

  

5. **Format and Tone**: Conclude by specifying the desired format and tone. This helps ensure the output meets practical needs, such as readability or formality.

   - Example: "Present the recommendations in bullet points and use a friendly, accessible tone."
