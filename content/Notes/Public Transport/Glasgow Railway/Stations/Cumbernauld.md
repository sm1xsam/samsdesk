Cumbernauld Station was built by the [[Caledonian Railway]] and opened on 7 August 1848. It was closed after just one year of operation, as Cumbernauld village was small, and not actually that close to the station. It was reopened in 1870, served by local passenger services from Buchanan St station on the lines towards Falkirk and Stirling.

Cumbernauld had a direct link to Glasgow to Buchanan St station until its closure in November 1966. From then on, trains from Cumbernauld terminated at Springburn, where passengers (like my dad) had to change to the North Clyde Line electric service to Queen St Low Level. A direct service was restored in May 1989. 
in the town of cumbernauld, evyer 400 houses had a cornershop - sometimes a converted farmhouse.
