Glasgow’s tram network was extensive, serving numerous districts across the city, from the centre out to suburban and even industrial areas. The routes were colour-coded on the map to indicate different services, making it clear at a glance which trams went where.

### City Centre and Major Streets

The tram network was heavily centred around Glasgow’s core areas like St. Vincent Place, Glasgow Cross, Argyle Street, and Sauchiehall Street. This concentrated flow meant that the city centre was well-connected to peripheral neighbourhoods and key locations. For example:

- **St. Vincent Place and Argyle Street** were prime spots with multiple trams converging, linking westward routes to places like **Kelvingrove, Partick, and Dumbarton Road**.
- **Gallowgate and Duke Street** served the east end, with routes extending to **Provanmill and Bridgeton**.
- **Victoria Road and Battlefield Road** covered the south side, reaching areas such as **Queen’s Park, Langside**, and eventually down towards **Clarkston and Netherlee**.

### Tram and Underground Connections

The tram system integrated well with the [[Glasgow Subway]], which has its own underground circular route. The Subway operated from around **06:30 to 23:45. on weekdays and Saturdays** and ran until about **23:15 on Sundays.** While the Subway today has roughly the same operating hours on weekdays and Saturdays, its Sunday service has been reduced to an often-talked about **10:00 to 18:12**, allowing time for maintenance. 

Key tram routes converged near underground stations at **St George’s Cross, Buchanan Street, and Bridge Street**, providing convenient interchange points. This seamless link between the tram and underground systems allowed Glaswegians to navigate the city’s full breadth with ease, hopping between surface and subterranean routes. 

The underground’s circular nature meant that connecting to trams could get you efficiently to major destinations like **Kelvinbridge, Hillhead, Govan, and Partick** – areas well-served by both networks.
